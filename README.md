# PYTHON-RETAIL-DATA-SET
This is one of the oasis infobythe python project

1. Overview / Introduction
This project focuses on understanding customer behavior by segmenting customers based on their purchasing patterns. By leveraging clustering algorithms and data visualization techniques, we aim to identify distinct customer groups and extract insights that can drive business decisions.
Motivation: Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to optimize marketing strategies, personalize customer interactions, and enhance customer satisfaction. This analysis helps businesses tailor their services to different customer segments effectively.
Problem Statement: How can we classify customers based on their purchase behavior to improve customer retention and business strategy?
